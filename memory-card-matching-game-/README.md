This project is a memory card game that is fun and interactive, where players test their memory by matching pairs of cards. The game starts with cards facing down, and players flip two cards at a time. If the cards match, they remain face up and if not, they turn back over and the player tries again. The goal is to match all pairs in as few moves as possible. This project is built using my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
